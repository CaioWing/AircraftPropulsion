# AircraftPropulsion
Propulsive code simulates and analyzes propulsion system performance. It models combustion processes, thrust generation, and efficiency. It optimizes and analyzes different operating conditions using various physical and mathematical models. system, allowing for optimization and analysis of different operating conditions.

This code aims to modulate a propulsion system. The 'main.py' file provides an example of its application. It was developed for a propulsion project and is still a work in progress. Some expressions may need to be reviewed and updated for improved accuracy.
